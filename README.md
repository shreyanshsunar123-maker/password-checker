A password checker. As my first git launch, I just wanted to give a little more effort to it and included several pattern checkers for detecting the password strength.
It has character repetition checker like - aaaa , bbbb , cccc.
Has word repetition checker like - same same same, foodfood, etc.
Has entropy checker determining the security level of a password.
Multiple other checkers for the use of symbol, number, small letters and capital letters.

All the checkers assign specific values to the pass_stren - password strength and we determine the password security level at last.
Also it gives suggetion to the user like using numbers, symbols, not to use repetitive words etc.

Hope to improve its toughness with increasing time.
